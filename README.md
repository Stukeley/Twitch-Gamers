# Twitch-Gamers
 
# What is this

This is a little exercise I did in RapidMiner on the Twitch Gamers dataset.

It includes several steps of working with the data:

- Storing
- Removing missing values
- Replacing column types (numeric to binomial)
- Normalizing
- Aggregating
- Grouping
- Displaying & Visualizing
- Creating a model which can predict the (binomial) label based on other attributes
